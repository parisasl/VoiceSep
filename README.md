# VoiceSep
In this project, I trained different models to classify voices and compared the accuracy of each model to find which one is better.

I have built a **logistic regression classifier** employing gradient descent to update the parameters. Moreover, I trained another logistic model **using Scikit-learn** library to compare the accuracy. 


Multilayer Perceptron is the other approach, and I built different model with different features using **Keras and TensorFlow library** to see how each feature affect the accuracy of the classifier.
