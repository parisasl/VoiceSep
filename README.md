# VoiceSep
In this project, I trained different models to classify voices and compared the accuracy of each model to find which one is better.

I have built a **logistic regression classifier** employing gradient descent to update the parameters. Moreover, I trained another logistic model using **Scikit-learn library** to compare the accuracy with the one that I built.


Multilayer Perceptron is the other approach that I used, and I built different model with different features using **Keras and TensorFlow library** to see how changing each feature and parameter will affect the accuracy of the classifier.
